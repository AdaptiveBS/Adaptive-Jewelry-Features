# Development Process & Relationship to Private Repository

## 🔄 How Features Move from Discussion to Development

This public repository serves as the **community input phase** of our adaptive jewelry feature development process. Here's how your discussions and feedback influence actual product development:

### 1. 💬 Community Discussion Phase (This Repository)
- **Feature requests** are submitted by community members
- **Discussions** happen around accessibility needs and use cases
- **Feedback** is gathered on proposed features
- **Prioritization** occurs based on community input and accessibility impact

### 2. 🏗️ Development Phase (Private Repository)
- Features with strong community support move to development
- Our engineering team works on implementation in our private repository
- **Security considerations**: IP protection, proprietary methods, and business logic
- **Quality assurance**: Internal testing and accessibility validation

### 3. 🧪 Testing & Refinement Phase
- Internal accessibility testing with diverse user groups
- Technical validation and durability testing
- Safety and regulatory compliance verification
- Iterative improvements based on testing results

### 4. 📢 Community Update Phase (Back to This Repository)
- **Development updates** are shared with the community
- **Beta testing opportunities** may be offered to community members
- **Pre-release feedback** is gathered for final adjustments

### 5. 🚀 Release Phase
- Features are released to production
- **Post-release feedback** continues in this repository
- **Iteration planning** begins for improvements and new features

## 🔒 Why We Use a Private Development Repository

### Intellectual Property Protection
- Proprietary adaptive mechanisms and innovations
- Manufacturing processes and supplier relationships
